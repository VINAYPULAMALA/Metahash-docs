title: "Validator Role in MetaHash"
description: "Validators in MetaHash SN73 act as liquidity allocators. They connect the treasury’s META budget with miners’ α supply, ensuring every 72-minute epoch clears deterministically and settles on-chain without discretionary intervention."
---

## Core Responsibilities per Epoch

### 1. Budget declaration
Validators publish their META allocation and discount ceiling (in basis points). These parameters are written to the treasury epoch ledger so miners know the maximum capacity and pricing bounds before bidding.

### 2. Auction supervision
During bidding windows validators:
- Monitor α offers from miners and subnet owners.
- Rank bids by discount-adjusted value.
- Fill bids sequentially until their declared budget is consumed.

### 3. Settlement and proof
At auction close validators:
- Execute settlements through treasury contracts.
- Record every cleared trade (α amount, discount, counterparty) inside an IPFS commitment file.
- Publish settlement receipts and block references so anyone can audit the flow.

### 4. Weight update
Validator weight recalculates at epoch transition using the following metrics.

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Settlement accuracy | Staying within budget increases future weight. |
| Response time | Faster fills improve reliability scoring. |
| Treasury alignment | Matching treasury receipts validates execution. |
| IPFS commitment validity | Missing or invalid hashes reduce weight. |

## Validator Rewards and Treasury Link

Validator incentives are performance-indexed: the better a validator clears auctions, the greater its future treasury budget share. Rewards flow directly from the 25 percent redistribution pool plus accuracy bonuses.

Treasury budget → Validator execution → Weight update → Treasury redistribution
```

| Reward Source | Allocation |
|---------------|-----------|
| Validator accuracy bonus | META distributed immediately after settlement. |
| Treasury redistribution | Share of the 25 percent pool based on weight. |
| Performance multipliers | Additional boosts for validators that maintain full commitment uptime. |

## Transparency and Governance

Every validator action is verifiable.

| Record | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Commitment files (IPFS) | Proof of filled bids and discount terms. |
| Budget declarations | On-chain metadata capturing per-epoch allocation. |
| Weight changes | Stored at epoch transition with before-and-after metrics. |

Governance monitors missed settlements, over-budget allocations, unverified hashes, and other compliance failures. Non-compliant validators automatically lose weight and redistribution share in the next epoch.

## Validators and Treasury: The Feedback Loop

```text
Treasury → Validators → Miners → Treasury
```

1. Treasury issues META budget.
2. Validators allocate it deterministically across α bids.
3. Miners receive liquidity and send α back to the treasury.
4. Treasury updates validator weights and redistributes rewards.

This continuous loop keeps liquidity balanced between all actors and ensures MetaHash’s on-chain economy remains efficient, auditable, and trustless.
