# Liquidity Routing Across the Network

MetaHash SN73 is the liquidity router of the Bittensor ecosystem, bridging α flow between subnet producers, the treasury, and external participants — ensuring value moves, recycles, and rewards seamlessly across the network.

## What Interoperability Means in SN73

Interoperability is liquidity synchronization. SN73 allows α originating in one subnet to move into another subnet’s economy through structured auctions and treasury-backed routing.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Economic interoperability | α can be sold, auctioned, or staked across subnets through the SN73 treasury. |
| Operational interoperability | Validators and miners participate in multiple subnets, keeping cross-epoch liquidity aligned. |
| Data interoperability | Commitment files and IPFS receipts are shared between ledgers for unified auditability. |

## The Cross-Subnet Flow

```text
Subnet 62 → SN73 Treasury → Validators and Funds → Buybacks and Airdrops → Other Subnets → Back to Treasury
```

1. **Source** – Production subnets such as 62 generate α and feed it into SN73 auctions.  
2. **Routing** – Validators and the treasury allocate liquidity per epoch, distributing META or α where demand is highest.  
3. **Redistribution** – The 75/25 treasury split recycles proceeds into buybacks, airdrops, and support for other subnets.  
4. **Verification** – Each transfer is hashed to IPFS and finalized through deterministic epoch consensus.


## Interoperability Mechanics

| Mechanism | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Epoch syncing | Subnets align reward cycles with SN73’s 72-minute epoch to enable predictable clearing. |
| Deterministic routing | Treasury and validators reroute α or META automatically toward demand zones. |
| Treasury cross-linking | Shared ledger entries track α source and destination to maintain one liquidity map. |
| Subnet collaboration | Subnet operators can allocate part of their α budget to SN73 for yield or liquidity provisioning. |

Any subnet can plug into SN73 for instant liquidity without rewriting its reward logic.

## Benefits of Cross-Subnet Liquidity

| Participant | Benefit | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Miners (e.g., subnet 62) | Sell α instantly at deterministic prices. | Offload surplus α through SN73 auctions. |
| Funds and validators | Access diversified α supply without managing multiple positions. | Acquire discounted α from several subnets via SN73. |
| Subnet operators | Gain liquidity support and smoother reward payouts. | Direct α output into SN73 as a liquidity sink. |
| SN73 holders | Capture yield from every subnet interacting with the treasury. | Increased volume drives buybacks and treasury growth. |


## How α Sharing Works

```text
α production → Deterministic auction → META and rewards → Buybacks and airdrops → Reinjection into other subnets
```

This cycle ensures no α goes idle, liquidity remains distributed yet traceable, and each subnet benefits from shared demand and predictable treasury backing.


## Why It Matters

Cross-subnet liquidity turns MetaHash from a single economic subnet into network-wide market infrastructure. It integrates miners, funds, and validators across multiple domains while preserving deterministic fairness and transparent accounting, keeping the entire Bittensor economy aligned on shared signals and liquidity standards.
