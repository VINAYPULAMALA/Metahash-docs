# How MetaHash Works

MetaHash is Subnet 73 on the Bittensor Finney testnet. It combines competitive α (alpha) bidding with a curated validator set to reward miners that supply high-quality signals and remain online.

## Network Roles

- **Miners** submit signals to validators and bid α to earn inclusion in the active set.
- **Validators** score miner outputs, settle auctions, and distribute rewards.
- **Funding Subnet 62** acts as the α source. Stake TAO on subnet 62 to mint α that can be spent on MetaHash auctions.
- **Treasury** receives a portion of on-chain fees to fund future grants and incentives.

## Auction Mechanics

<Info>
MetaHash uses continuous sealed auctions. Bidders specify the funding subnet, α amount, and discount in basis points (bps).
</Info>

1. **Bidding** – Miners place bids with `--miner.bids.netuids`, `--miner.bids.amounts`, and `--miner.bids.discounts`.
2. **Validation** – Validators score miners and record winning bids.
3. **Settlement** – Winning bids trigger α transfers to validators and open room for the next block of bidders.
4. **Rewards** – Active miners receive emissions proportional to performance and stake.

## Operational Checklist

- Keep port `8091/tcp` open to the internet so validators can reach your axon.
- Export wallet credentials through a `.env` file and make sure it is in `.gitignore`.
- Monitor bids and auction logs; missing `AuctionStart` events usually points to networking issues.
- Use `screen`, `tmux`, or `systemd` to ensure the miner restarts automatically.
