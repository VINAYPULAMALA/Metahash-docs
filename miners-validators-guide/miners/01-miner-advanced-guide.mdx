description: "This guide walks you through the **basic setup** (environment, wallet + hotkey), the **miner ↔ validator flow**, and how to run the miner so your α payments are correctly counted during settlement."

## Setup instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install MetaHash">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fx-integral/metahash.git
    cd metahash
    python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip wheel uv
    uv pip install -e .
    cp .env.template .env
    # Edit .env with WALLET_PASSWORD and optionally BITTENSOR_NETWORK
    # Or unlock wallet interactively by starting the miner
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create wallet & hotkey; register on SN73">
    ```bash
    btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name mywallet
    btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey miner1
    btcli register --netuid 73 --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey miner1
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fund the wallet">
    Ensure your coldkey has enough TAO to register and process transactions to operate.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Run the Miner

```bash
python neurons/miner.py \
  --netuid 73 \
  --wallet.name mywallet \
  --wallet.hotkey miner1 \
  --subtensor.network "ws://x.x.x.x:9944" \
  --miner.bids.netuids 71 72 73 \
  --miner.bids.amounts 1.0 0.5 0.25 \
  --miner.bids.discounts 500 700 900 \
  --axon.port 8091 \
  --axon.external_port 8091 \
  --logging.debug \
  --payment.validators $source-stake-hotkeyA $source-stake-hotkeyB $source-stake-hotkeyC
```

<Warning>
`--payment.validators` are **hotkeys where stake will be transferred from**.
`--miner.bids.discounts` are **basis points (bps)** — not percent.
- `500` = 5%
- `700` = 7%
- `900` = 9%
</Warning>

## High-Level Overview (Miner ↔ Validator)

The miner participates in a multi-epoch cycle with validators:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Epoch e: Bid">
    **AuctionStart** – Validator broadcasts auction start.

    **Bids from miner** – You submit bid lines:
    ```
    (subnet_id, alpha_amount, discount_bps)
    ```

    Where:
    - `subnet_id` – target subnet to support with α
    - `alpha_amount` – how much α you offer
    - `discount_bps` – **basis points (bps)** where 1 bp = 0.01%
      - `500` = 5%
      - `700` = 7%
      - `900` = 9%
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Clearing & Win">
    **Validator clearing** – Bids ranked by **TAO value** with slippage & optional reputation caps; partial fills allowed.

    **Win invoice (still epoch e)** – If accepted, you receive `Win` with **payment window** `[as, de]` (block numbers) occurring in **epoch e+1**.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Epoch e+1: Pay">
    **Miner sends α** – Pay within `[as, de]` to a **known treasury** (see `metahash/treasuries.py`).

    <Warning>
    With `STRICT_PER_SUBNET=true`, each accepted bid line must be **paid on its own subnet**.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Epoch e+2: Settle">
    **Settlement & weights** – Validator verifies payments, **burns underfill** to UID 0, and sets weights on-chain.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding `discount_bps`

Each bid includes a `discount_bps` field, which sets the **maximum discount you are willing to accept** on the value of your α, after adjusting for slippage and validator-specific subnet weights.

### Basis Points Explained

**Basis points (bps):** 1 bp = 0.01%
- `0` bps = no discount (you expect full value)
- `500` bps = 5% max discount
- `2500` bps = 25% max discount

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Subnet weight applies baseline haircut">
    Subnet weights apply an implicit haircut. For example, a subnet weight of `0.8` means you already face a 20% baseline discount.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Your discount_bps sets the maximum">
    Your `discount_bps` sets the maximum haircut you are willing to accept, including this baseline.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validator enforces your limit">
    The validator ensures your **effective discount never exceeds your configured max**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Protection against unfavorable conditions">
    If the subnet's baseline discount is greater than your max, the bid is not sent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example 1: Accepted Bid" icon="check">
    - **Subnet weight** = `0.8` (20% haircut)
    - **Your discount** = 25% max (`2500` bps)
    - **Effective discount applied** = 5% (difference between 25% and 20%)
    - **Result:** You receive 75% of your α's value ✅
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example 2: Tight Fill" icon="arrows-to-circle">
    - **Subnet weight** = `0.95` (5% haircut)
    - **Your discount** = 25% max (`2500` bps)
    - **Effective discount applied** = 25% – 5% = 20%
    - **Result:** You receive 75% of your α's value ✅
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example 3: Rejected Bid" icon="xmark">
    - **Subnet weight** = `0.7` (30% haircut)
    - **Your discount** = 25% max (`2500` bps)
    - **Result:** Since 30% > 25%, the bid is **not sent** ❌
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Why This Matters

<Warning>
**Set and forget:** You can specify the maximum discount you're comfortable with and the code guarantees you will never be forced into a worse deal.

**Certainty and safety:** This provides predictability, similar to OTC markets where miners typically offer ~10–20% discounts.
</Warning>
