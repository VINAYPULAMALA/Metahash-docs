title: Auction Mechanics
description: Understand MetaHash's Epoch-based auction cycle and how bids move from submission to rewards.
---

## Overview

MetaHash operates a **continuous, Epoch-based auction system** that keeps Œ± liquidity flowing into Subnet 73. Each Epoch spans **360 blocks (~72 minutes)** and follows a deterministic three-phase cycle:

    Miners submit competitive bids with Œ± amounts and discounts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Payment" icon="credit-card" color="#ff9f2e">
    Winners transfer Œ± to validators within the payment window

## How It Works

*The continuous Epoch cycle showing the three-phase auction process*

<Info>
**Key Insight:** Validators anchor each Epoch using Yuma Consensus. Winners are deterministic, and payments have dedicated windows to guarantee fairness and finality.

## Epoch T ‚Äî Auction & Clearing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preparation (blocks 0‚Äì50)">
    <Check>Finalize prior-Epoch rewards via Yuma Consensus</Check>
    <Check>Stage budget, discount caps, and payment windows for the new Epoch</Check>
    <Check>Reset auction state so every miner begins from a clean slate</Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Live bidding (blocks 50‚Äì340)">
    <Check>Validators broadcast `AuctionStart` once preparation completes</Check>
    <Check>Miners submit bids `(subnet_id, Œ±_amount, discount)`; multiple bids allowed</Check>
    <Check>Competition focuses on discounted value after slippage adjustments</Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close-out (blocks 340‚Äì360)">
    <Check>Validators rank bids by deterministic value and reputation limits</Check>
    <Check>Winning bids are paired with payment instructions for the next Epoch</Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Epoch T+1 ‚Äî Commitment & Payment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="üìã Payment Instructions" icon="clipboard-list">
    Winners receive **"pay by block X"** instructions once validators publish commitments (CID ‚Üí IPFS). Each commitment includes:
    - Winning bid amount
    - Payment deadline (block number)
    - Treasury wallet address
    - Verification CID for transparency
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="‚è±Ô∏è Payment Window" icon="clock">
    Payment windows typically span **~100 blocks** (~20 minutes) to give miners sufficient time to:
    - Verify their winning status
    - Confirm Œ± balance in payment hotkey
    - Submit on-chain transfer to treasury
    - Monitor transaction confirmation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="‚úÖ Payment Verification" icon="badge-check">
    All Œ± transfers to the whitelisted treasury account are:
    - **On-chain verifiable** via Bittensor blockchain explorer
    - **Immutable** once confirmed
    - **Tracked** by validators for settlement scoring
    - **Transparent** through IPFS commitments
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Critical:** Late or missing payments roll into the next Epoch as unpaid bids. Set up monitoring alerts on your payment hotkey to avoid missing deadlines!
</Warning>

## Epoch T+2 ‚Äî Settlement & Rewards

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Verification">
    Validators scan the Bittensor chain for matching Œ± transfers from winning miners. Each transaction is verified against the commitment CID published in the previous Epoch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Weight Calculation">
    **Scoring Logic:**
    - ‚úÖ **Paid bids:** Receive full weight based on bid amount and discount
    - ‚ùå **Missed payments:** Drop to zero weight, losing their slot
    - üî• **Unspent budget:** Automatically burned to UID 0 to maintain tokenomics
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rewards Distribution">
    Final weights are applied on-chain (or previewed in testing mode), and TAO emissions are distributed proportionally to winning miners based on their performance and stake.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Reference

<Note>
**Epoch Duration:** Each complete cycle takes approximately **360 blocks (~72 minutes)**
</Note>

| Phase | Blocks | Duration | Key Actions |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Auction (Epoch T)** | 0‚Äì360 | ~72 min | Prep ‚Üí Live bids ‚Üí Close-out |
| **Payment (Epoch T+1)** | 360‚Äì470 | ~20 min | Commit winners ‚Üí Accept Œ± payments |
| **Settlement (Epoch T+2)** | 470‚Äì540 | ~14 min | Verify payments ‚Üí Apply weights |

<Tip>
Visual dashboards may label these phases as **Accepting Bids**, **Payment Window**, and **Rewards / Finalization**‚Äîsame workflow, just different terminology!

## Key Terminology

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Œ± (Alpha)" icon="coins">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Epoch" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    A 360-block cycle (~72 minutes) that represents one complete auction round from bidding through settlement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CID (Content Identifier)" icon="fingerprint">
    An IPFS hash used to verify validator commitments and ensure transparency in the auction process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Yuma Consensus" icon="handshake">
