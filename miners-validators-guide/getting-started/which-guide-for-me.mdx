| Already run miners elsewhere and juggle α sources | [Miner Advanced Guide](/miners-validators-guide/miners/miner-advanced-guide) | You need custom payment routing or auto-recovery scripts |
| Run one validator and recently earned permits | [Validator Simple Guide](/miners-validators-guide/validators/validator-simple-guide) | You require redundancy, custom scoring, or telemetry |

## Guided Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Your Role">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Miner</strong> — Converting α to META through auctions.</li>
      <li><strong>Validator</strong> — Clearing auctions, publishing commitments, managing treasuries.</li>

    </ul>
  </Step>

    <p>Simple guides favor copy-paste flows on a single box. Advanced guides assume comfort with automation flags, multiple instances, or monitoring stacks.</p>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Readiness">
    <ul>
      <li>Run <code>btcli wallet list</code> to confirm your hotkey exists.</li>
      <li>Check validator permits with <code>btcli subnet list --netuid 73</code> if you plan to accept bids.</li>
      <li>Ensure hardware meets the <a href="/miners-validators-guide/getting-started/introduction">environment prerequisites</a> and required ports are open.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
