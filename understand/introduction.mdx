![MetaHash Working](/icon/images/metahash-working.png)

**MetaHash connects dTAO holders, validators, and miners through a transparent auction cycle, creating a decentralized marketplace that connects capital holders with capital seekers through fair, deterministic auctions.**

Think of it like this:

- **dTAO holders** can deploy their idle α across multiple subnets without mining.
- **Miners & subnet operators** can bid for α access to grow their operations.
- **Validators** run transparent auctions with on-chain commitments and slippage-aware clearing.
- **Everyone** benefits from fair price discovery and deterministic weight allocation.

## Network Roles

- **Miners** submit signals to validators and bid α to earn inclusion in the active set.
- **Validators** score miner outputs, settle auctions, and distribute rewards.
- **APY** Stake α on Treasury will earn APY on the Treasury which is used for buybacks.
- **Treasury** receives a portion of on-chain fees to fund future grants and incentives.

### Overview

Each auction cycle matches dTAO liquidity from Emission with miner demand on subnet 73. Validators run the clearing logic every block, so winning bids begin earning emissions almost immediately once the auction settles.

### Lifecycle

1. **Bidding** – Miners place bids with `--miner.bids.netuids`, `--miner.bids.amounts`, and `--miner.bids.discounts`.
2. **Validation** – Validators score miners and record winning bids.
3. **Settlement** – Winning bids trigger α transfers to validators and open room for the next block of bidders.
4. **Rewards** – Active miners receive emissions proportional to performance and stake.
