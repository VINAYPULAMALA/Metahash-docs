## TL;DR Decision Matrix

| If you… | Start with… | Upgrade when… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Just funded your first miner hotkey | [Miner Simple Guide](/guides/miners/miner-simple-guide) | You want automation, multiple bids, or monitoring hooks |
| Already run miners elsewhere and juggle α sources | [Miner Advanced Guide](/guides/miners/miner-advanced-guide) | You need custom payment routing or auto-recovery scripts |
| Run one validator and recently earned permits | [Validator Simple Guide](/guides/validators/validator-simple-guide) | You require redundancy, custom scoring, or telemetry |
| Operate institutional infra with on-call coverage | [Validator Advanced Guide](/guides/validators/validator-advanced-guide) | You start delegating operations to multiple teams |

## Guided Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Your Role">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Miner</strong> — Converting α to META through auctions.</li>
      <li><strong>Validator</strong> — Clearing auctions, publishing commitments, managing treasuries.</li>
      <li><strong>Explorer</strong> — Still learning? Start with the <a href="/introduction">Introduction</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Match Experience Level">
    <p>Simple guides favor copy-paste flows on a single box. Advanced guides assume comfort with automation flags, multiple instances, or monitoring stacks.</p>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Readiness">
    <ul>
      <li>Run <code>btcli wallet list</code> to confirm your hotkey exists.</li>
      <li>Check validator permits with <code>btcli subnet list --netuid 73</code> if you plan to accept bids.</li>
      <li>Ensure hardware meets the <a href="/guides/environment/environment">environment prerequisites</a> and required ports are open.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
