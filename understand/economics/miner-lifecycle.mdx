title: "Miner Lifecycle & Performance"
description: "Miners in MetaHash SN73 are α producers. They transform computational output from other subnets into tradable liquidity, then route that liquidity through SN73’s deterministic auctions to receive META. Participation hinges on positioning α at the right discount and maintaining consistent execution every 72-minute epoch."

## The Miner Lifecycle

Every epoch follows a repeatable loop: source α, bid, clear, settle, and recycle.

1. **Source α supply**  
   - α typically originates from subnet stakes such as subnet 62.  
   - This supply represents the liquidity available to sell in the next auction window.

2. **Submit bids**  
   - Each bid specifies the α amount and a discount in basis points (for example, `500 bps = 5%`).  
   - Multiple bids are allowed while the window is open, and miners can adjust parameters until cutoff.

3. **Auction clearance**  
   - Validators rank bids by discount-adjusted value and fill them sequentially until the epoch budget is exhausted.  
   - Cleared bids transfer the offered α into the treasury; uncleared bids immediately free the α for the next epoch.

4. **Settlement and liquidity receipt**  
   - Cleared miners receive META directly from treasury contracts with receipts anchored to IPFS.  
   - Settlement proves which bids cleared, at what discount, and for which counterparties.

5. **Performance feedback**  
   - Miners with consistent participation and fair pricing maintain higher win probability.  
   - Non-competitive bids or frequent gaps in participation result in lower fill rates and weaker telemetry scores.

> Mining in SN73 rewards price discipline and execution reliability rather than raw hash power.

## Miner Incentives

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Instant liquidity | α can be sold OTC without AMMs or manual OTC desks. |
| Deterministic pricing | Auctions clear based on transparent logic, eliminating slippage and MEV. |
| Treasury yield exposure | Cleared α powers treasury buybacks that lift long-term SN73 value. |
| Continuous opportunities | Each 72-minute epoch resets bidding, giving miners frequent liquidity windows. |

## Miner Yield Recycling Loop

```text
Subnet 62 → Miner produces α → Bid in SN73 → META received → Treasury recycles proceeds → Buybacks and airdrops → Miner benefits indirectly
```

This flow keeps miners engaged in both production and liquidity cycles, reinforcing the link between subnet work and treasury value.

## Miner Performance Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Importance |
|--------|------------|------------|
| α supplied per epoch | Total α offered into auctions. | Determines participation weight. |
| Bid discount (bps) | Price competitiveness metric. | Lower discount usually clears first. |
| Fill rate | Percentage of bids that clear each epoch. | Measures efficiency and pricing accuracy. |
| Settlement accuracy | Number of cleared bids correctly referenced on IPFS. | Confirms auditable participation. |
| Uptime | Consistency of epoch participation. | Impacts reputation and validator trust. |

Consistent miners build trust and deepen liquidity, both critical in a deterministic market.

## Miner–Treasury Relationship

All miner liquidity flows through the SN73 Treasury, guaranteeing:

- Immediate META payment upon clearance.  
- No manual settlement risk.  
- Transparent accounting via commitment files and block references.

Because every transfer is verifiable on-chain, miners can prove execution and reconcile balance sheets without third-party escrow.

## Why Miner Behavior Matters

Miner behavior defines liquidity depth for MetaHash. More miners submitting competitive α creates healthier price discovery and stronger treasury yields. SN73 miners are not passive yield farmers; they are active liquidity providers fueling the network’s self-balancing economy across every deterministic epoch.
