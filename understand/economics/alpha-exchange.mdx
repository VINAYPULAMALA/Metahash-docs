description: "MetaHash’s liquidity engine runs on α (alpha) — a measure of commitment, not a tradable token.Miners use α to bid for emissions each epoch, turning staking into a live auction."

## Why α Instead of Raw TAO?

| Design Goal | How α Achieves It |
| --- | --- |
| **Fairness** | Miners compete on α efficiency, not wallet size. |
| **Recycling** | α returns to circulation every epoch — no permanent lock-ups. |
| **Dynamic Pricing** | The cost of subnet access reprices as α demand shifts. |
| **Stability** | α absorbs short-term TAO volatility, keeping auctions predictable. |

## How α Flows

### 1. Bidding (Epoch T)

During the live bidding window, miners submit `(subnet_id, α_amount, discount_rate)` pairs. Validators compute an **effective value** for each bid:

```
effective_value = α_amount × (1 – discount_rate)
```

Higher effective values float to the top of the book.

### 2. Clearing & Commitment (Epoch T Close-out → T+1)

Validators deterministically select the top bids, move the committed α into the treasury, and publish payment instructions. This marks the miner’s obligation for the next epoch.

### 3. Reward Recycling (Epoch T+2)

Once Yuma Consensus finalizes the epoch, the treasury converts the committed α into proportional TAO rewards. Those rewards flow back to the winning miners, and the α they deployed becomes available for the next bidding round.

```
Miner → α Bid → Validator → Treasury
Treasury → TAO Rewards → Miner
```

## Market Participants

| Participant | Role | Incentive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Miner** | Provides α liquidity and submits competitive bids | Earns TAO in proportion to auction success |
| **Validator** | Verifies bids, ranks them, and triggers clearing | Gains clearing reputation + operational incentives |
| **Treasury** | Holds α inflows, automates reward distribution | Maintains economic stability for SN73 |

Each epoch forms a self-contained auction loop: bid → clear → settle — all within ~72 minutes.

## Example Auction Snapshot

| Miner | α Bid | Discount | Effective Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 100 α | 5% | 95 α | Wins if threshold is below 95 |
| B | 150 α | 15% | 127.5 α | Wins if booked capacity allows higher value |

If the validator clears Miner B, 127.5 α is logged as the commitment. When Epoch T+1 closes, Miner B receives TAO rewards scaled to that effective value.

## Economic Implications

- **Price discovery** – α bidding surfaces real demand for subnet access.
- **Liquidity velocity** – α constantly recycles, deepening available liquidity.
- **Emission feedback** – reward rates self-adjust as α inflows wax or wane.
- **Equilibrium behavior** – over time, α’s “price” reflects subnet utility rather than speculation.

## Mental Model

Picture a circuit:

1. **Miner node** emits orange α packets toward the **Validator hub**.
2. Validator routes winning flows into the **Treasury vault**.
3. Treasury returns cool-blue SN73 α rewards back to the miner.

That loop repeats every epoch — the economic heartbeat of MetaHash.
