title: Critical Safety Warnings
description: MetaHash touches live wallets, α transfers, and validator treasuries. Failure to follow the warnings below will result in permanent, unrecoverable loss of funds.
---

<Warning>
NEVER send META tokens to validators. Validators only accept α payments. META sent to a validator address cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

<Warning>
ONLY send α to officially whitelisted treasury addresses. Always confirm the exact address in `treasuries.py` and cross-check in Discord before every payment.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Start with tiny α test payments so you can confirm the address, memo, and transaction fee before sending your full amount.
</Tip>

<Info>
You must keep at least **0.1 τ (TAO)** in your wallet for gas fees. Transactions without sufficient τ fail, and missed payments can remove you from the auction rotation.
</Info>

## Quick Safety Checklist

- Double-check that the token you are sending is α, not META.
- Verify the treasury address against `treasuries.py` and an out-of-band source.
- Send a dust payment first; confirm it lands before pushing the full amount.
- Maintain a τ buffer for transaction fees on every wallet you control.
- Pause and ask in Discord if anything looks different from the documented flow.

Following these steps keeps your wallets, validators, and treasuries safe. Skipping them can permanently burn capital—there are no refunds on-chain.
