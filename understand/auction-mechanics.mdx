## Continuous Cadence

## Epoch T — Auction & Clearing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preparation (blocks 0–50)">
    <Check>Finalize prior-Epoch rewards via Yuma Consensus</Check>
    <Check>Stage budget, discount caps, and payment windows for the new Epoch</Check>
    <Check>Reset auction state so every miner begins from a clean slate</Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Live bidding (blocks 50–340)">
    <Check>Validators broadcast `AuctionStart` once preparation completes</Check>
    <Check>Miners submit bids `(subnet_id, α_amount, discount)`; multiple bids allowed</Check>
    <Check>Competition focuses on discounted value after slippage adjustments</Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close-out (blocks 340–360)">
    <Check>Validators rank bids by deterministic value and reputation limits</Check>
    <Check>Winning bids are paired with payment instructions for the next Epoch</Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Epoch T+1 — Commitment & Payment Window

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="📋 Payment Instructions" icon="clipboard-list">
    Winners receive **"pay by block X"** instructions once validators publish commitments (CID → IPFS). Each commitment includes:
    - Winning bid amount
    - Payment deadline (block number)
    - Treasury wallet address
    - Verification CID for transparency
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="⏱️ Payment Window" icon="clock">
    Payment windows typically span **~100 blocks** (~20 minutes) to give miners sufficient time to:
    - Verify their winning status
    - Confirm α balance in payment hotkey
    - Submit on-chain transfer to treasury
    - Monitor transaction confirmation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Payment Verification" icon="badge-check">
    All α transfers to the whitelisted treasury account are:
    - **On-chain verifiable** via Bittensor blockchain explorer
    - **Immutable** once confirmed
    - **Tracked** by validators for settlement scoring
    - **Transparent** through IPFS commitments
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Critical:** Late or missing payments roll into the next Epoch as unpaid bids. Set up monitoring alerts on your payment hotkey to avoid missing deadlines!
</Warning>

## Epoch T+2 — Settlement

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Verification">
    Validators scan the Bittensor chain for matching α transfers from winning miners. Each transaction is verified against the commitment CID published in the previous Epoch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rewards Distribution">
    Final weights are applied on-chain (or previewed in testing mode), and TAO emissions flow per the treasury distribution rules. See [Treasury Structure](/understand/treasury-structure) for payout logic.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Reference

<Note>
**Epoch Duration:** Each complete cycle takes approximately **360 blocks (~72 minutes)**
</Note>

| Phase | Blocks | Duration | Key Actions |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Auction (Epoch T)** | 0–360 | ~72 min | Prep → Live bids → Close-out |
| **Payment (Epoch T+1)** | 360–470 | ~20 min | Commit winners → Accept α payments |
| **Settlement (Epoch T+2)** | 470–540 | ~14 min | Verify payments → Apply weights |

<Tip>
Visual dashboards may label these phases as **Accepting Bids**, **Payment Window**, and **Rewards / Finalization**—same workflow, just different terminology!
