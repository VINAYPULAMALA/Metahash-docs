title: "MetaHash Overview"
description: MetaHash SN73 is a meta-mining subnet within the Bittensor network built to bridge α liquidity between miners, funds, and the treasury layer. It acts as a decentralized OTC counter, letting α holders exit positions instantly while giving allocators predictable, discounted exposure through transparent on-chain auctions.

  MetaHash SN73 transforms α liquidity into a continuous OTC marketplace — bridging miners, funds, and treasury through deterministic auctions.

## Why MetaHash Matters

    MetaHash introduces a predictable, deterministic way to move liquidity inside the Bittensor economy. By combining on-chain auctions, treasury-backed settlements, and epoch-based transparency, SN73 eliminates the volatility and slippage of conventional AMMs.

### Two sides, one engine

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="α Holders" icon="users">
    **Miners & Subnet Owners**

    Sell α directly into MetaHash's treasury without disrupting charts or AMM depth while keeping continuous yield.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Capital Allocators" icon="chart-line">
    **Funds, Validators & Strategists**

    Acquire α through fixed-budget auctions and OTC trades at known discount rates, backed by on-chain settlements.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**MetaHash aligns those who produce α with those who deploy capital into it.**

## How It Works

<div style={{
  padding: '1.5rem',
  background: 'rgba(255, 140, 0, 0.08)',
  border: '1px solid rgba(255, 140, 0, 0.2)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem'
}}>
  MetaHash runs on a <strong>deterministic Epoch Auction Cycle</strong> — a continuous 72-minute liquidity loop where miners and validators interact through pre-announced budgets.
</div>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Notify & Stage">
    Validators announce budgets and reset the auction state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bidding & Submission">
    Miners submit α bids with chosen discounts (in basis points).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clearing & Matching">
    Validators rank bids and fill them sequentially until capacity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commitments & IPFS Records">
    Results are hashed and published for public verification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payments & Settlement">
    Funds and α are exchanged on-chain with treasury receipts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Weight Update & Next Epoch">
    Validators are scored, weights update, and the next epoch starts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Epochs are deterministic** — no manual clearing, no human discretion. Every transaction, bid, and settlement is verifiable through consensus and IPFS commitments.

## Role Inside Bittensor

<Tip>
**MetaHash is the liquidity infrastructure for Bittensor's subnet economy.** Miners get instant exits, institutions get discounted exposure, and every transaction is verifiable on-chain.
