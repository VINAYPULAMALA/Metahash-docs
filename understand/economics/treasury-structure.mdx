title: "Treasury & Reward Flow — MetaHash SN73 Liquidity Engine"
description: "How the SN73 Treasury powers buybacks, airdrops, and validator weighting through deterministic Epoch settlements."

## How the Treasury Works per Epoch

Each epoch the treasury executes three coordinated operations:

1. **Inflow – α acquisition**  
   α sold by miners and subnet owners (for example, subnet 62) enters through deterministic auction settlements. Validators verify every commitment so the treasury only accepts bids with matching on-chain records.

2. **Processing – liquidity conversion**  
   Treasury contracts issue META or stable-denominated liquidity to the corresponding sellers, then stage the acquired α for staking, pairing, or future auctions.

3. **Outflow – value redistribution**  
   Proceeds follow the 75/25 policy at the end of each epoch: 75 percent funds SN73 buybacks and liquidity support, while 25 percent is automatically airdropped to wallets that meet the `S_MIN_AIRDROP` threshold.

## Validator Integration

Validators participate as liquidity allocators, not just block producers.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Budget declaration | Validators announce META budgets each epoch and clear bids against treasury α supply. |
| Settlement proofs | Every transfer to or from the treasury is hashed and stored on IPFS for later audit. |
| Performance weighting | Validators that clear accurately gain higher weight for subsequent epoch allocations. |

> Performance equals liquidity accuracy — validators that settle on time and within budget expand their influence inside SN73.

## The Reward Feedback Loop

```text
Miners → Treasury → Funds and Validators → Buybacks and Airdrops → SN73 Holders → Next Epoch
```

This closed loop ensures that liquidity never leaves the MetaHash economy, every participant contributes to the same yield cycle, and treasury transparency anchors trust between miners, validators, funds, and holders.

## Transparency & Audit Trail

All treasury operations are recorded on-chain and anchored to IPFS artifacts.

| Record Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Commitment files | Contain bid fills, pricing, and transfer references per epoch. |
| Settlement receipts | Document fund-to-miner payments cleared during the epoch. |
| Buyback transactions | Track SN73 repurchases, burns, and liquidity support events. |
| Airdrop logs | Identify reward distribution wallets above the staking threshold. |

Anyone can verify these records using the associated IPFS CIDs or block heights, making the SN73 treasury a fully auditable liquidity engine.
