    This page orients you around MetaHash's core concepts and components and maps out the path to understand Subnet 73 ecosystem.
  </p>
</div>

Every decentralized system needs a rhythm like a predictable way for value to move between creation and circulation.
**MetaHash SN73** brings that rhythm to Bittensor Ecosystem.

Subnet 73 (SN73) is Bittensor's dedicated liquidity coordination layer. It runs as a purpose-built subnet whose sole job is to convert raw α rewards from any production subnet into META-denominated liquidity without exposing contributors to speculative order books. SN73 sits between the metagraph's commodity-producing subnets and the capital allocators, acting like the settlement rail that keeps the broader Bittensor economy in phase.

The overview below shows how MetaHash links α-producing subnets, validators, and the treasury into a single circulation loop.

Metahash acts as the **liquidity router** of the network, transforming subnet 'α' into liquid, tradable value through **predictable OTC auctions**.
Instead of chaotic order books or speculative markets, MetaHash relies on fixed epoch interval to connect miners, validators, and the treasury in a transparent, fair system of exchange.

## Why MetaHash?

Bittensor's subnets generate a variety of digital commodities each representing intelligence, computation, or data production.
However, the rewards earned within those subnets often remain siloed as α.
While miners produce value, and investors seek productive yield, the two rarely meet without creating price noise or on-chain friction, so **MetaHash** was designed to solve this imbalance.

MetaHash fixes that mismatch by enforcing deterministic OTC auctions every epoch, guaranteeing that α supply hits the treasury at pre-committed prices and sizes. Validators synchronize bids across subnets, then the treasury recycles the cleared META back into the network through buybacks and targeted airdrops. Discount bands are posted before the epoch based on the META budget earmarked by the treasury, so sellers know the exact window they will clear. The result is a tight feedback loop: production subnets know when liquidity will arrive, and capital providers can deploy without destabilizing the metagraph.



- **Liquidity → unified market.** SN73 allows α from any subnet to be exchanged for META through predictable OTC auctions.
- **No market shocks.** Epochs clear trades in timed cycles, aligning sellers and buyers at the same moment.
- **Real yield, not speculation.** Liquidity flows back into the ecosystem through buybacks and airdrops, recycling value rather than draining it.

    MetaHash ensures that value created anywhere in Bittensor can move everywhere, continuously.

## Core Components of MetaHash

MetaHash operates as a subnet with its own internal economy and roles.
Each role contributes to the network's equilibrium:
 **Miners**
- Produce and supply α generated from subnet activity.
- Participate in predictable OTC auctions to convert α into liquid tokens.
- Depend on validators for fair clearing and treasury execution.
**Validators**
- Verify auction bids, validate commitments, and confirm settlements.
- Maintain fairness, ensuring that miners' α conversions follow the shared rule set.
- Are rewarded for upholding auction integrity and treasury synchronization.
**Treasury**
- Acts as the clearinghouse and balance sheet of MetaHash.
- Splits proceeds between **buybacks (75%)** and **airdrops (25%)**.
- Reinjects liquidity into miners and subnet participants, sustaining circulation.

Together, these components create a self-rebalancing system: α moves from **production → verification → redistribution** in each epoch.

## How MetaHash Works

MetaHash functions on a **predictable epoch cycle** that's continuous.
Each epoch follows a structured flow:

1. **Auction Phase** — Miners and subnet owners sell α via bids at transparent discounts.
2. **Validation Phase** — Validators review, verify, and commit winning bids to the ledger.
3. **Settlement Phase** — The treasury executes payments, conducts buybacks, and redistributes rewards.

After settlement, the next epoch begins—forming a continuous liquidity cycle that never overlaps or drifts off-schedule. This design keeps MetaHash synchronized across all participants, allowing value to flow predictably and fairly throughout the Bittensor network.

## Why It Matters

MetaHash transforms how subnet output becomes liquidity.
It provides:
- A **predictable OTC market** for α sales.
- A **clear bridge** between technical productivity (miners) and capital allocation (validators).
- A **feedback-driven treasury** that recycles yield into network strength.

By doing so, SN73 enhances the overall efficiency of Bittensor's incentive layer.
It ensures that intelligence work, computation, and capital form a single economic heartbeat rather than disconnected silos.

## Simplified MetaHash Network

**Example flow**

1. Subnet 5 ends an epoch with 1,000 α. Miners bundle that output and post it to the next SN73 auction window.
2. The auction clears at the posted discount band for that epoch. Validators confirm the bids and forward the totals to the treasury.
3. The treasury pays the miners in META, uses 75% of remaining META for buybacks, and airdrops the other 25% to aligned holders.

This simple path shows how MetaHash routes work output into fresh liquidity and puts the proceeds back into the network without noise.

## At a Glance

- **Epoch cadence:** Every 360 blocks
- **Auction model:** Deterministic OTC cycle
- **Liquidity loop:** Miners → Validators → Treasury → Miners
- **Reward split:** 75% buybacks / 25% airdrops
- **Purpose:** Convert α into liquid, productive yield across the Bittensor network
