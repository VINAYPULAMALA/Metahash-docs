# Miner Lifecycle Overview

Miners are the execution layer of MetaHash. They supply the compute, uptime, and α liquidity that keep subnets running. Validators guard fairness, treasuries clear rewards, but miners fuel the auction loop: **Join → Bid → Win → Commit → Earn → Reset**. Each full loop aligns with the ~72-minute epoch cadence.

## Stage 1 — Join & Initialize

1. **Create wallet + hotkey** to establish on-chain identity.
2. **Configure environment** with SN73 parameters, ports, and dependencies.
3. **Register on SN73** once so the node can auto-enroll in every subsequent epoch.

## Stage 2 — Bid with α

During the live auction window, miners submit bids such as:

```
(subnet_id=73, α=120, discount=10%)
```

- Multiple bids per epoch are allowed.
- Discounts express willingness to trade margin for priority.
- Bids remain editable until the window closes.
- Validators see each signed bid instantly.

## Stage 3 — Win the Auction

When bidding ends:

- Validators rank miners via `effective_value = α × (1 – discount)`.
- Top effective values clear; others have their α immediately freed for the next round.
- Winners join the active mining set for the upcoming epoch.

## Stage 4 — Commit & Contribute

Winning miners must deliver:

- **Compute commitment** – run workloads, submit signals, maintain uptime.
- **Liquidity commitment** – the winning α stays locked until settlement.
- **Performance telemetry** – latency, health, and validation data stream to the network.

Missing performance targets can reduce rewards or trigger partial slashing.

## Stage 5 — Earn & Settle

After validators finalize the epoch:

- The treasury converts committed α into TAO emissions based on effective share.
- Each miner receives rewards proportional to α contribution plus reliability.
- The locked α returns to the miner’s wallet, ready for new bids.

All payouts are transparent and traceable on-chain.

## Stage 6 — Reset & Re-enter

- Nodes automatically roll into the next auction unless paused.
- Reputation and performance history carry forward.
- Consistent miners often win at lower α cost because validators trust their reliability.

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Emission share** | Portion of α converted into TAO | Determines payout weight |
| **Uptime** | Active participation percentage per epoch | Affects eligibility next epoch |
| **Reputation** | Multi-epoch reliability score | Influences future bid efficiency |

Secondary metrics include latency, error rate, and bid consistency.

## Behavior Across Epochs

- **High-efficiency miners** reinvest rewards to scale α.
- **Casual miners** drop in with smaller lots when conditions suit them.
- **Strategic operators** track emission trends and bid during quieter windows.

Over time the network self-organizes: competitive enough to maintain fairness, stable enough to retain sustainability.

## Mental Model

Picture a looping timeline:

1. Orange α packets leave the miner toward validators.
2. Validators confirm “WIN” and route commitments to the treasury.
3. Blue TAO rewards flow back to the miner.
4. The cycle repeats with the caption “Epoch → Epoch → Epoch.”
