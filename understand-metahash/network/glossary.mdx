# Summarizes

This glossary summarizes the terms used throughout MetaHash SN73 docs, covering auctions, epochs, α liquidity, validator responsibilities, and treasury mechanics.

## Core Network Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Bittensor** | Decentralized neural network protocol that hosts subnets such as SN73. |
| **Subnet** | Specialized network focused on a distinct function or economy inside Bittensor. |
| **SN73 (MetaHash)** | MetaHash’s subnet identifier; the deterministic α liquidity engine. |
| **Validator** | Participant allocating META budgets and executing deterministic auctions per epoch. |
| **Miner** | Participant producing α from upstream subnets and selling it through SN73’s OTC auctions. |
| **Treasury** | On-chain vault managing liquidity inflow/outflow, buybacks, and reward redistribution. |


## Epoch and Auction Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Epoch** | 72-minute deterministic cycle covering auction, clearing, settlement, and rewards. |
| **Epoch cycle** | Notify → Bid → Clear → Commit → Settle → Reweight loop powering SN73. |
| **Deterministic auction** | Rule-based auction where bids clear predictably based on disclosed budgets and discounts. |
| **Discount (bps)** | Price reduction miners offer, quoted in basis points (100 bps = 1%). |
| **Auction budget** | META amount validators allocate per epoch to purchase α. |
| **Auction clearing** | Phase where validators rank bids and match them to budget sequentially. |
| **Auction commitment** | Final record of cleared bids hashed to IPFS for audit. |


## Liquidity and OTC Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **OTC counter** | The on-chain mechanism for direct α-for-META swaps outside AMMs. |
| **Liquidity engine** | Treasury system that recycles auction inflows and redistributes rewards. |
| **Buyback program** | Treasury operation allocating 75% of proceeds to SN73 buybacks or liquidity support. |
| **Airdrop program** | Treasury distribution of the remaining 25% to wallets above `S_MIN_AIRDROP`. |
| **α exchange** | Conversion between α supplied by miners and META provided by the treasury. |
| **α liquidity flow** | Continuous movement of α among miners, treasury, and other subnets. |


## Validator and Miner Metrics

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Validator weight** | Score dictating how much budget a validator can allocate based on accuracy. |
| **Settlement accuracy** | Precision with which a validator executes settlements within limits. |
| **IPFS commitment file** | Public log of bids, clears, and settlements per epoch. |
| **Miner fill rate** | Share of a miner’s bids that clear each epoch. |
| **α supply** | Total α a miner offers during an auction window. |
| **Bid discount** | Specific discount applied by a miner to accelerate clearing. |


## Interoperability Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Cross-subnet liquidity** | Ability to move α and META across other subnets via SN73. |
| **Treasury cross-link** | Accounting mechanism tracking α source and redistribution path. |
| **Epoch sync** | Alignment of other subnets’ reward cycles with SN73’s auction window. |
| **Liquidity routing** | Automated redirection of α or META to subnets where demand is detected. |


## Governance and Transparency

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Commitment proof** | IPFS or on-chain reference confirming a validator’s settlement. |
| **Weight decay** | Penalty applied when validators fail to supply valid commitments. |
| **Settlement receipt** | On-chain acknowledgment of α and META exchange completion. |
| **Governance audit** | Ongoing validation of epoch records, buybacks, and treasury movements. |

## Conceptual Overview

```text
Miners → Treasury → Validators → Buybacks → Stakers → Next Epoch
```

All SN73 terminology ultimately ties back to this loop: miners produce α, the treasury converts it into META, validators ensure deterministic settlement, and rewards recycle value back into the network.
