**Community Question**: Why has my miner not placed a single bid even after running for several days?

# UID111 Review â€” MetaHash SN73 Miner

A firsthand account of setting up and running a MetaHash miner on Subnet 73 (Finney Testnet).

## Snapshot

- **Platform**: Ubuntu 22.04 on AWS t3.medium
- **Setup Time**: ~40 minutes using documented Python 3 + venv + `uv` flow
- **Wallet**: Created with `btcli wallet new_coldkey` / `new_hotkey`, registered to Subnet 73
- **UID**: 111
- **Funding**: Î± sourced from Subnet 62, bidding 0.25 Î± at 500 bps
- **Persistence**: Runs continuously with `screen` or systemd

## What I Ran

```bash
# System setup
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip git

# Python environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip wheel uv
uv pip install -e .
pip install -U bittensor-cli

# Wallet creation
btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name mywallet
btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey miner1
btcli subnets register --netuid 73 --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey miner1

# Staking
btcli stake add --netuid 62 --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey miner1 --amount 0.15

# Running the miner
python neurons/miner.py \
  --netuid 73 \
  --wallet.name mywallet \
  --wallet.hotkey miner1 \
  --subtensor.network finney \
  --miner.bids.netuids 62 \
  --miner.bids.amounts 0.25 \
  --miner.bids.discounts 500 \
  --axon.port 8091 \
  --axon.external_port 8091 \
  --logging.debug \
  --blacklist.force_validator_permit \
  --payment.validators 5H9WDbXXtJVoMRAGM3EgqZPZBk5A4d57PthhxsNrb6hBXsz7
```

## Run Experience

### Environment Configuration

`.env` lives in the repo root with these variables:

```bash
WALLET_NAME=mywallet
WALLET_HOTKEY=miner1
WALLET_PASSWORD=yourpassword
BITTENSOR_NETWORK=finney
```

<Warning>
Missing the `WALLET_PASSWORD` line had the miner looping for input until I fixed it.
</Warning>

### Successful Launch

First good launch shows:

```
Axon served with: AxonInfo(5H9WDbXXt..., 18.xx.xx.xx:8091)
Miner started
Configured Bid Lines:
  0 â”‚ 62 â”‚ 0.2500 Î± â”‚ 500 bps
Miner runningâ€¦
```

### Auction Activity

When working properly, logs show:

```
AuctionStart detected
Win invoice received
Î± payment sent
```

<Check>
These logs confirm the validator path is working and your miner is participating in auctions.
</Check>

### Network Setup

- **Port 8091**: Opened TCP 8091 in AWS security group
- **Verification**: Used `ss -tulpn | grep 8091` to confirm listening
- **Critical**: This was the gate to being seen on the network

### Process Management

- **Testing**: `screen -S miner` was fine for early testing
- **Production**: Switched to systemd for auto-restarts
- **Monitoring**: `journalctl -u metahash-miner -f` to watch logs

## Gotchas I Hit

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Python Command Issues">
    **Problem**: Using `python` without the alias broke the flow

    **Fix**: Needed to call `python3` explicitly in several spots
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dependency Version Mismatch">
    **Problem**: Imports failed without correct async-substrate-interface version

    **Fix**: Pinning to version 1.3.1 solved it:
    ```bash
    pip install async-substrate-interface==1.3.1
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong Payment Validator">
    **Problem**: Misconfigured `--payment.validators` to an unstaked hotkey

    **Result**: Watched Î± burn with no rewards

    **Fix**: Used `btcli stake overview` to align the correct address
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Port Not Accessible">
    **Problem**: When `AuctionStart` never appeared, port 8091 was closed

    **Fix**: Once I opened it in AWS security group, bids flowed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Out of Memory (OOM)">
    **Problem**: On a t3.micro dry run, the miner hit OOM and died

    **Fix**: Upgraded to t3.medium and added 2G swapfile:
    ```bash
    sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
    sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
    sudo mkswap /swapfile
    sudo swapon /swapfile
    echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CLI Command Changes">
    **Problem**: Old `swap` command no longer worked

    **Fix**: `btcli subnets alpha_to_tao` replaced the old syntax
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Block Drift / Desync">
    **Problem**: Block drift presented as "Extrinsic not included"

    **Fix**: Running `python neurons/miner.py --fresh` pulled the miner back in sync
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Learnings

### Critical Configuration Points

1. **`.env` file is mandatory** - Include all variables, especially `WALLET_PASSWORD`
2. **Port 8091 must be open** - Both in AWS and locally accessible
3. **Payment validator must have stake** - Otherwise Î± payments fail
4. **Memory matters** - t3.micro insufficient; t3.medium recommended
5. **Clock sync is important** - Install chrony to prevent drift

### Recommended Instance Specs

| Spec | Minimum | Recommended |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Instance Type | t3.small | t3.medium |
| Memory | 2GB | 4GB |
| Swap Space | 1GB | 2GB |
| Disk Space | 10GB | 20GB |
| Network | Standard | Enhanced |

### Timeline Expectations

| Milestone | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Initial setup | 30-40 minutes |
| First successful start | +5 minutes |
| Port verification | +5 minutes |
| First auction event | Hours to days |
| Consistent operation | Ongoing |

<Info>
Don't panic if you don't see auction events immediately. Validator activity varies, and it can take time for your miner to be selected.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting Tips from Experience

### When Things Go Wrong

1. **Check logs first**: `tail -f ~/.bittensor/miners/mywallet/miner1/netuid73/miner.log`
2. **Verify port**: `ss -tulpn | grep 8091`
3. **Check stake**: `btcli stake overview`
4. **Monitor resources**: `htop` and `free -h`
5. **Resync if needed**: `python neurons/miner.py --fresh`

### Red Flags to Watch For

- ðŸš¨ No "Axon served" message on startup
- ðŸš¨ Password prompts appearing repeatedly
- ðŸš¨ Port 8091 not showing in `ss` output
- ðŸš¨ Memory usage climbing steadily
- ðŸš¨ "Killed" messages in logs

### Green Lights

- âœ… "Miner started" in logs
- âœ… "Configured Bid Lines" displayed
- âœ… Port 8091 listening externally
- âœ… Stable memory usage
- âœ… "AuctionStart" events appearing

## Final Thoughts

The setup process is **straightforward if you follow the documentation** carefully. Most issues stem from:

- Missing or incorrect `.env` configuration
- Closed or misconfigured ports
- Wrong payment validator addresses
- Insufficient system resources

<Tip>
Start with a t3.medium instance to avoid memory issues. You can always downsize later if your miner is stable and memory usage is low.
</Tip>

## Configuration That Worked

This exact configuration ran successfully for multiple days:

- **Instance**: AWS t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Stake**: 0.15 TAO on Subnet 62
- **Bid**: 0.25 Î± at 500 bps discount
- **Port**: 8091 open (TCP inbound)
- **Management**: systemd service with `Restart=always`
- **Swap**: 2GB swapfile configured

## Community Resources

When I got stuck, these resources helped:

- **Discord**: Active community for real-time help
- **GitHub Issues**: Check for similar problems
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive troubleshooting guides
- **Twitter**: Updates on validator activity and network status

## Recommendations for New Miners

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the full documentation first">
    Don't skip steps or assume defaults
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use recommended instance specs">
    t3.medium or equivalent, not t3.micro
  </Step>

  <Step title="Double-check .env configuration">
    All four variables must be present
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify port accessibility">
    Both locally and externally before waiting for auctions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use systemd for production">
    Screen is fine for testing only
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor regularly">
    Check logs daily for the first week
  </Step>

  <Step title="Join the community">
    Discord is invaluable for troubleshooting
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bottom Line

UID111's experience shows that with proper setup and configuration, running a MetaHash miner is **achievable in under an hour**. The key is:

- Following documentation precisely
- Verifying each step before proceeding
- Using adequate system resources
- Monitoring logs for confirmation
- Asking for help when stuck

<Check>
With this approach, your miner should be operational and participating in auctions successfully!
