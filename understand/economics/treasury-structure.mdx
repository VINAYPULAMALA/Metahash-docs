title: Treasury & Reward Flow
description: How MetaHash turns competitive α inflows into stable, verifiable TAO rewards every epoch.
---

# Overview
The treasury is MetaHash’s settlement engine. Every epoch it ingests α from cleared auctions, send the Emmision α to miners and validators who made the market. Its mandate is simple: keep rewards proportional to economic contribution while smoothing volatility across epochs.

## 1. Treasury Mission

1. **Proportional rewards** — SN73 α payouts mirror the α actually committed, not just static stake.
2. **Emission stability** — Short-term bidding spikes shouldn’t whiplash the subnet’s emission schedule.

## 2. Inflow Sources

| Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **α bids** | Winning miners pay α into the treasury each epoch; this is the primary liquidity feed. |
| **Validator fees** | A reserved slice of α/TAO that compensates validators for clearing and consensus. |
| **Emission rollover** | Unspent TAO or α from prior epochs held back as a buffer. |

At each epoch boundary the treasury snapshots:

```
total_alpha_inflow
total_validator_fees
previous_epoch_balance
```

Those numbers define the emission pool for the next payout.

## 3. Conversion Cycle (α → TAO)

After Yuma Consensus finalizes Epoch E, the treasury runs a deterministic pipeline:

1. **Assess performance** – Validators sign off on winning bids and their committed α.
2. **Calculate emission target** – Compare fresh α inflows to the subnet’s emission quota; apply coefficient `k` to avoid over-issuance.
3. **Distribute TAO rewards** – Mint or allocate TAO up to the allowed cap and weight payouts by each miner’s effective α share (validators collect their service fee here).
4. **Re-open liquidity** – Once payouts finalize, the same α re-enters circulation for Epoch E+1 bidding.

Lifecycle summary:

```
α inflow → Treasury pool → TAO emission → Miner & Validator rewards → α released
```

## 4. Distribution Curve (Typical)

| Recipient | Share | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Miners** | 60% | Performance rewards tied to effective α. |
| **Validators** | 25% | Clearing fees + consensus incentives. |
| **Treasury reserve** | 10% | Liquidity buffer and risk pool. |
| **Development fund** | 5% | Tooling, analytics, and maintenance. |

Percentages adjust via subnet governance, but the principle remains: miners receive the majority, validators get operational incentives, and a buffer safeguards future epochs.

## 5. Balancing & Stabilization

- **Emission cap control** – If α inflows spike, the multiplier `k` drops to keep TAO issuance steady.
- **Reserve recycling** – Unused rewards roll into the next epoch, dampening volatility.
- **α burn option** – When liquidity overwhelms demand, a small fraction of α may be permanently retired.
- **Floor reserve** – A minimum TAO balance guarantees payouts during quiet periods.

## 6. Economic Effects

- **Stability loop** – α demand drives emissions; emissions influence α value, creating a self-correcting cycle.
- **Fairness** – Rewards scale with α efficiency instead of raw capital.
- **Sustainability** – Caps and reserves prevent runaway inflation and protect TAO’s long-term value.
- **Transparency** – Validator-signed commitments and on-chain transfers keep every payout auditable.

## 7. Visual Mental Model

Imagine a dark-themed diagram:

1. Orange α streams enter a central **Treasury Vault**.
2. Blue TAO flows branch out toward **Miners** and **Validators**.
3. A circular arrow feeds α back into the next epoch.
4. A shaded **Reserve bar** shows stored liquidity for balancing.

That intake → conversion → payout → recharge loop is the heartbeat of MetaHash’s economy.
